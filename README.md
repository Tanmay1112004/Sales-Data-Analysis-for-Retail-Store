📊 Sales Data Analysis for Retail Store 🛒
🚀 Overview
Welcome to the Sales Data Analysis for Retail Store project! This Python-based analysis dives into retail sales data to uncover trends, test hypotheses, and visualize performance across product categories. Using statistical approaches, it empowers retail managers to make data-driven decisions for inventory and marketing strategies. 📈
📋 Project Description
In today’s competitive retail landscape, understanding sales performance is key to success. This project analyzes a synthetic dataset of 20 products across four categories—Electronics, Clothing, Home, and Sports—to achieve the following objectives:

Summarize Sales: Compute descriptive statistics to understand sales distribution. 📉
Test Hypotheses: Use inferential statistics to evaluate average sales against a target value. 🔍
Visualize Insights: Create compelling visualizations for quick decision-making. 📊

🗃️ Dataset
The dataset is synthetically generated with the following features:

product_id: Unique product identifier.
product_name: Product name (e.g., Product 1, Product 2).
category: Product category (Electronics, Clothing, Home, Sports).
units_sold: Number of units sold (Poisson distribution, λ=20).
sale_date: Date of sale (Jan 1–20, 2023).

🔍 Analysis Breakdown
📈 Descriptive Statistics

Mean, Median, Mode: Central tendencies of units sold.
Variance & Standard Deviation: Variability in sales data.
Category Insights: Total and average sales per category.

📉 Inferential Statistics

Confidence Intervals: 95% and 99% intervals for the mean units sold. 🎯
Hypothesis Testing: One-sample t-test to check if mean sales differ from 20 units. 🧪

📊 Visualizations

Histogram: Distribution of units sold with mean, median, and mode lines. 📈
Boxplot: Sales spread and outliers by category. 📊
Bar Plot: Total units sold per category. 📉

🎉 Example Output

Descriptive Statistics:Mean Units Sold: 18.80
Median Units Sold: 18.50
Mode Units Sold: 17
Variance: 10.91
Standard Deviation: 3.30


Category Statistics:   Category  Total Units Sold  Average Units Sold  Std Dev
0  Clothing               21              21.00    NaN
1  Electronics            73              18.25    2.22
2  Home                  181              20.11    3.72
3  Sports                101              16.83    2.71


Confidence Interval (95%):(17.25, 20.35)


Hypothesis Test:T-statistic: -1.63, P-value: 0.12
Fail to reject null hypothesis: Mean sales not significantly different from 20.



🖼️ Visualizations
The script generates:

Histogram: Shows sales distribution with marked mean, median, and mode.
